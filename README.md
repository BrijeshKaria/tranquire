# tranquire
An .NET web UI automation framework based on the screenplay pattern implemented in Serenity BDD

Introduction
------------
Tranquire brings the [screenplay pattern](http://www.infoq.com/articles/Beyond-Page-Objects-Test-Automation-Serenity-Screenplay) to .NET. It is highly inspired by the implementation of [Serenity BDD](http://www.serenity-bdd.info). You can refer to the Serenity documentation to understand how Tranquire works.
Its goal is to better organize UI acceptance tests and make them more maintainable and readable, by applying the single responsability and open-closed principles to UI actions.

Tranquire provides an abstraction layer on top of [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/).
